Above all, I want to express my gratitude to my supervisors, Prof. Harith Alani and Dr. Alistair Willis, for their unwavering support and guidance throughout my research. They were always available to discuss any problems or inquiries I had and provided valuable feedback.
I would like to give a special thanks to Prof. Harith Alani for his thought-provoking questions that helped me stay on track with my research. His talent for simplifying complex ideas into understandable concepts demonstrated that every problem can be solved with the proper approach and clear explanations.
I am grateful for the technical assistance provided by Dr. Alistair Willis, which enabled me to effectively frame and focus the most intricate section of my thesis. Through his invaluable support, I gained valuable insight into designing strong experiments and critically analysing results.

% guidance showed me the importance of good writing in research. Hopefully, his ability to spot the smallest typos and grammatical errors made me a better writer.

I would like to express my gratitude to my friends and colleagues at the Knowledge Media Institute (KMi) and Computing \& Communications (C\&C) for their support throughout my studies. Their assistance has been invaluable to me. Paula, Angel, Angelo, Lucas, Alba, Agnese, Gianluca, Cecilia.

And thanks to the two musical bands that accompanied me during this 3-year period, \emph{KMinstruments} and \emph{I Gabbiani}, that provided a good and motivating distraction and made the time more enjoyable. 

Finally, I would like to thank my mum, dad, brother, and sister for supporting me over all these years and spurring me to continue and not give up.

Last but not least, I would like to thank Giorgia for her unofficial supervising abilities and motivation to push me all the times I lost my energy. Her ability to deal with a PhD researcher, stressed and anxious about the experiments failing and this never-ending thesis, cannot be expressed in words.
