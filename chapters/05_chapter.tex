\section{Introduction}

% In this chapter we investigated the persuasion techniques. But we have not studied the relationship between this observed persuasion in the text and the ideals/agenda/perspective of the author/outlet. It can be really useful to understand the context around the source of an article in order to interpret its persuasion.
% For this reason, the next chapter will consider perspectives and political sides. In this way we will try to understand if the persuasion of each political side is similar or which are the differences. If a different goal for the persuasion also can be observed on the persuasion itself.

In this new chapter, we introduce a new factor in our analysis.
Having in the previous ones covered persuasion and propaganda, we were showing the need of understand the context around the source of an article in order to interpret its persuasion.

For this reason, this chapter introduces the factor of \emph{perspectives and political sides}.
Our goal is to see and understand how persuasion (and more specifically propaganda) varies across the political spectrum. If political points of view of the sources can be so diverse, what do they use differently in news articles to persuade the readers? Is there a link between the political orientation and the persuasion used?
% How does political point of view influence the usage of propaganda?

% Perspectives and Political Sides. What drives  the variations and propaganda? Which political interests? 

Our Research Questions for this chapter are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How does propaganda varies across the political spectrum?
    \item Can we predict the political leaning of a news article by observing the propaganda it uses?
    \item Is Propaganda Detection balanced?
\end{itemize}



TODO: New structure (similar to chap 4):
- new ingredient: political leaning (datasets, prediction)
- combination with previous ingredients


\section{Political Leaning Prediction}
\label{sec:ps_political_sides}

Here we describe Political Leaning Prediction.

\subsection{Political Leaning Definition}

From literature

Political leaning over Left/Right axis: Left/Right definitions

Points from Left and Right ideologies

\subsection{Datasets for Political Leaning Prediction}

Datasets annotating sources:

- MBFC
- AllSides

Datasets of articles? Is article always considered with the same leaning as source?

\subsection{Models for Political Leaning Prediction}

How it is computed

Usual features

State of the Art

Problems: learning the source instead of learning L/R task

\section{Propaganda and Political Leaning Prediction}

Here we want to see the relationship between Propaganda (studied in the previous Chapter~\ref{ssec:lp_techniques_propaganda} and Political Leaning (from the previous Section~\ref{sec:ps_political_sides}.

\subsection{Propaganda across political spectrum}
Experiment 4.3: comparison of sentiment/propaganda across political leaning

\subsection{Political leaning prediction using propaganda features}
5: political leaning classifier from propaganda features. Why


Why the two could benefit / be related?

The point of contact between political leaning prediction and propaganda is that both are dealing with political analysis.
Given that the facts that are being narrated are the same (exception: inclusion/exclusion), the main difference between an article from the left to one from the right is their point of view / subjective / persuasive component. Propaganda analysis is focused on analysing this specific component of the articles, the anti-topic model.
On this, we have our hypothesis that \emph{we can recognise the political leaning of an article by using the features provided by the propaganda analysis}.
The mixed analysis would allow to understand better why a certain article is classified as being left/right with respect to the black box BERT classifier.

The following sections first describe the general setup of the experiment, then deal with each one of the three research questions that we listed in the introduction: quantity, quantity by type, terms analysis.% TODO , context.


Unlike previous work on political leaning detection, in this paper we use a propaganda detection method (from \citet{da2019fine}) to identify the existence of propaganda and its type of technique in given articles, and incorporate this information directly as additional features into the training and testing of the model.  


\subsection{Other datasets for political leaning prediction}
6: classifier (propaganda → leaning) on other datasets

TODO: split this in 
1. data subsection (needed) and in
2. results of political leaning prediction subsection (previous subsection)

\subsection{Propaganda datasets are unbalanced}

8: propaganda datasets are unbalanced

   \caption{The leaning of the propagandist sources from MBFC (TODO compare with effective training dataset, which is 100\% right)}
   \label{fig:mbfc_leaning}
\end{figure}

- Possible problems?
A possible problem of this approach that is not defended in the paper, is the choice of articles that have been annotated by experts. They have been selected from sources "propagandistic by Media Bias/Fact Check", in other words from the page \url{https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/fake-news/}. The propagandistic sources listed in this page, as Figure~\ref{fig:mbfc_leaning} shows, are mostly on the extreme-right side of the spectrum. Furthermore, the selection done by the authors (table 3 of that paper) results in all the sources of the articles to lean on the right.
So the resulting model is \textbf{being trained on very propagandistic sources from the right only}. The model will not be able to see left-propaganda because it never saw it in the training phase.



\subsubsection{Populism and Propaganda by leaning}

This is the continuation of Section~\ref{ssec:lp_techniques_populism_vs_propaganda} from the previous chapter. Now that we introduced the leaning and the problem of unbalance, we are going to break down the analysis with respect to the political leaning of the speeches.
% Dataset found: populism in political speeches %https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/LFTQEZ&version=2.0 
% Each annotator (4 for each speech) gave a score between 0 (non-populistic) to 2 (very populistic)
% 4961 rows 
% 1240 deduped (352 left, 256 center, 469 right, 652 NA)
% Languages: 265 en (304 es, 148 pt, …),
% Leaning of the english ones: (36 left, 37 center, 84 right, 106 NA)

These 265 speeches all have a leaning classification (we will see more about leanings in the next chapter): 36 left, 37 center, 84 right, 106 NA. We use this information in order to check whether the results that we get are general across the political spectrum.

RESULTS

L/R evaluation:
Assumption: propaganda correlates to populism similarly in L/C/R
Result total: 0.225 Left, 0.005 Center, 0.374 Right → Why? Is it a matter of quantity of populism/propaganda?
Populism average:  [0.1259, 0.0729, 0.2712]
Propaganda average: [0.0165, 0.0271, 0.0432]
Ratio: [0.1317, 0.3717, 0.1593] → populism over propaganda ratio is a bit bigger on right (21\% more), but the correlation Right is bigger than left of 66\%. So it is less likely that this is just a matter of quantity. On the Right, propaganda and populism are strongly linked

Findings

Propaganda and populism are correlated, but not too strongly. In the Right more. This is one point supporting the hypothesis that propaganda detection works better in the Right than in the Left. → unbalanced detection caused by unbalanced data
