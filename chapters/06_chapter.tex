\label{chap:topics}


RQs:
- does it change across topics?
- knowing the topic, does it make classification (prop-->leaning) easier?

How this relates to other chapters


TODO: New structure (similar to chap 4):
- new ingredient: topic
- combination with previous ingredients


two documents:

Experiment 7: contains an analysis of different ways of extracting/using topics on my dataset. Here I show some breakdown by topic using some topics annotations in the dataset (AllSides topics), and also with the values from TextRazor (CoarseTopics, Fine-grained topics, but not yet using the hierarchical MediaTopics)

Expanding the topics of AllSides: also includes the analysis of MediaTopics (IPTC)


For the code, I have two parts:
https://github.com/MartinoMensio/textrazor-bulk-annotate which can be used to annotate a dataset (this is the script I used to annotate the datasets that you gave me in the past).
attached the code from a private repository (bcanalytics) which contains some functions to handle the taxonomy (file src/textrazor.py ) and to plot the sunburst diagrams (file experiments/text\_razor.ipynb)
