\label{chap:topics}


RQs:
- does it change across topics?
- knowing the topic, does it make classification (prop-->leaning) easier?

How this relates to other chapters


TODO: New structure (similar to chap 4):
- new ingredient: topic
- combination with previous ingredients


two documents:

Experiment 7: contains an analysis of different ways of extracting/using topics on my dataset. Here I show some breakdown by topic using some topics annotations in the dataset (AllSides topics), and also with the values from TextRazor (CoarseTopics, Fine-grained topics, but not yet using the hierarchical MediaTopics)

Expanding the topics of AllSides: also includes the analysis of MediaTopics (IPTC)


For the code, I have two parts:
https://github.com/MartinoMensio/textrazor-bulk-annotate which can be used to annotate a dataset (this is the script I used to annotate the datasets that you gave me in the past).
attached the code from a private repository (bcanalytics) which contains some functions to handle the taxonomy (file src/textrazor.py ) and to plot the sunburst diagrams (file experiments/text\_razor.ipynb)

\subsubsection{Why TextRazor}
Regarding the validation of TextRazor, I am not aware of a benchmark done to check if it is better than other tools. It was suggested by Harith to use it, and I find that the data it provides is generally quite good (for topics and entities). But this is qualitatively, I didn’t do a benchmark or looked up for benchmarks. The assumption was that it’s a commercial product and it should be good.
I found some papers that claim to do benchmarks but I didn’t read them:
http://giusepperizzo.github.io/publications/Rizzo\_Erp-LREC2014.pdf for the entities
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/google-nli-kill-market-linguistic-apis-review-yuri-kitin/ mentioning that TextRazor is useful because it links to Wikipedia/DBPedia

I chose TextRazor also because it’s the only one that I found that provides already hierarchical topics, the other ones always give topics that are not hierarchical or can be made hierarchical with external knowledge (e.g. using DBPedia to navigate broader topics)

\section{Topic and Propaganda and Leaning prediction}
